## What is this Project?

In December 2018 Douglas Robar (Umbraco Man) hung up his Umbraco Cape and started a new adventure. He put out a call on Twitter to see if anyone would take on the task of looking after the site H5YR.com. I, Owain, answered the call and am now the keeper of the site. 

The domain H5IS.com is also now going to be part of this project - Thanks to Harald Ulriksen for transferring the domain to this project.

The plan is to make this a community project but it's not just for Umbracians. It's for everyone. H5YR and H5IS are not just Umbraco terms, although the Umbraco Community have adopted them. 

## What is needed / planned?

Initially, the plan is to just convert the old site from Umbraco 6 to Umbraco 7 and keep the original functionality - which is to scan Twitter for all #h5yr and #h5is tags and display them on the site.
